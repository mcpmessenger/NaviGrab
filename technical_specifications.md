# Technical Specifications for C++ Playwright Clone

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications for a C++ implementation of a Playwright-like browsing and scraping tool, specifically designed for integration into a custom Chromium fork. The primary goal is to replicate Playwright's screenshot browsing, proactive scraping, and element interaction capabilities within a C++ environment, leveraging Chromium's internal architecture for efficiency and deep integration.

The tool will enable automated navigation, interaction with web page elements (buttons, links), comprehensive screenshot capture (full page, element-specific), and intelligent, proactive scraping of page content. All captured data, including screenshots and scraped information, will be stored within Chromium's storage mechanisms.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The C++ Playwright clone will operate as an internal component within the Chromium browser, rather than an external automation client. This deep integration allows for direct access to Chromium's rendering engine, DOM, and network stack, providing a high degree of control and performance. The architecture will consist of several key modules:

*   **Browser Control Module:** Responsible for navigating to URLs, managing browser contexts (tabs/windows), and handling page lifecycle events.
*   **DOM Interaction Module:** Provides methods for locating, interacting with (clicking, typing), and extracting information from DOM elements. This module will mimic Playwright's robust locator and actionability features.
*   **Screenshot Capture Module:** Handles the capture of screenshots, supporting various modes such as full-page, viewport, and element-specific captures. It will leverage Chromium's internal rendering capabilities.
*   **Proactive Scraping Module:** Implements logic for automatically identifying and interacting with interactive elements (buttons, links) and capturing their states or resulting page changes. This module will also manage data extraction from the DOM.
*   **Storage Integration Module:** Manages the persistent storage of captured screenshots and scraped data within Chromium's internal storage (e.g., IndexedDB, Local Storage, or a custom Chromium storage solution).
*   **API Layer:** Exposes the functionality of the above modules to other parts of the custom Chromium fork, potentially through a C++ API or an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanism if components reside in different Chromium processes.

This internal architecture aims to provide a seamless and performant solution for automated web content acquisition and analysis directly within the browser.



## 2.1 Browser Control Module

The Browser Control Module will be responsible for managing the browser's state and navigation. It will provide functionalities akin to Playwright's `page` and `browser` objects. Key features include:

*   **Navigation:** Programmatic control over URL navigation, including `goto()`, `goBack()`, `goForward()`, and `reload()` methods. This will involve interacting with Chromium's navigation controller.
*   **Context Management:** Ability to create and manage isolated browser contexts, similar to Playwright's `browser.newContext()`. Each context will have its own cookies, local storage, and session data, ensuring test isolation. This maps directly to Chromium's `BrowserContext` concept.
*   **Page Management:** Creation and management of new pages (tabs/windows) within a browser context. This includes methods to open new pages, close existing ones, and switch between them.
*   **Lifecycle Events:** Exposure of page lifecycle events such as `load`, `domcontentloaded`, `networkidle`, and `close`, allowing the scraping logic to react to page state changes.
*   **Viewport and Emulation:** Configuration of viewport size, device emulation (e.g., mobile devices), and user agent strings to simulate various browsing environments.

This module will primarily interface with Chromium's `content` module, specifically `WebContents` and `NavigationController`, to achieve its functionalities. It will ensure that all navigation and context operations are performed reliably and efficiently within the Chromium environment.



## 2.2 DOM Interaction Module

The DOM Interaction Module will provide the means to locate and interact with elements on a web page, mirroring Playwright's powerful locator and actionability features [3]. This module will be crucial for simulating user interactions and extracting data.

*   **Element Locators:** Support for various locator strategies, including CSS selectors, XPath, text content, accessibility roles (`getByRole`), placeholder text (`getByPlaceholder`), and alt text (`getByAltText`). These locators will be implemented to efficiently query the DOM within Chromium's rendering engine.
*   **Actionability Checks:** Before performing any action (e.g., click, fill), the module will implement Playwright's auto-waiting mechanism to ensure the target element is visible, stable, enabled, and receives events [3]. This prevents flaky interactions and ensures reliable automation.
*   **User Actions:** Emulation of common user interactions such as `click()`, `fill()` (for input fields), `type()` (character-by-character input), `check()`/`uncheck()` (for checkboxes/radio buttons), `selectOption()` (for dropdowns), `hover()`, and `dragTo()`. These actions will leverage Chromium's internal event dispatching mechanisms to simulate genuine user input.
*   **Element State and Properties:** Methods to retrieve element properties (e.g., `textContent`, `innerHTML`, `value`, attributes) and check their state (e.g., `isVisible()`, `isEnabled()`, `isChecked()`).
*   **Event Listeners:** Ability to attach listeners to DOM events, allowing the scraping logic to react to dynamic changes on the page, such as new elements appearing or content being updated.

This module will deeply integrate with Chromium's Blink rendering engine, utilizing its DOM access and event handling capabilities. The goal is to provide a robust and reliable way to interact with web content, resilient to dynamic page changes.



## 2.3 Screenshot Capture Module

The Screenshot Capture Module will provide robust functionality for capturing visual representations of web pages and specific elements, similar to Playwright's `page.screenshot()` and `locator.screenshot()` methods [1]. This module will leverage Chromium's internal rendering pipeline for efficient and high-fidelity image generation.

*   **Full Page Screenshots:** Capability to capture a screenshot of the entire scrollable page, effectively rendering content beyond the current viewport. This will involve coordinating with Chromium's rendering engine to ensure all content is drawn before capture.
*   **Viewport Screenshots:** Capture of the currently visible area of the browser window. This is the default behavior and will be optimized for speed.
*   **Element Screenshots:** Ability to capture a specific DOM element, including its bounding box and any overflow content. This will require precise calculation of element coordinates and dimensions within the rendering tree.
*   **Output Formats:** Support for common image formats such as PNG and JPEG, with configurable quality settings for JPEG. The module should also allow capturing the screenshot directly into a memory buffer for further processing, mimicking Playwright's `buffer` option [2].
*   **Transparency and Clipping:** Options to control background transparency (for elements) and define custom clipping regions for screenshots.

This module will interface directly with Chromium's rendering and compositing layers, likely utilizing `cc::LayerTreeHost` and `content::RenderWidgetHostView` to trigger rendering and retrieve pixel data. The goal is to provide a flexible and performant screenshot capability that can be used for visual regression testing, content archiving, and debugging.



## 2.4 Proactive Scraping Module

The Proactive Scraping Module is central to the requested functionality, enabling automated exploration of web pages, interaction with dynamic elements, and systematic data collection. This module will intelligently traverse web pages, identify interactive elements, simulate user actions, and capture relevant information, including screenshots, at each significant step.

*   **Automated Page Traversal:** The module will implement algorithms to explore a web page by identifying all clickable elements (links, buttons, form submissions) and systematically interacting with them. This can involve a breadth-first or depth-first search approach to cover all reachable states of a web application.
*   **Element Identification and Prioritization:** Using the capabilities of the DOM Interaction Module, the scraping module will identify interactive elements. Prioritization logic will be implemented to determine which elements to interact with first, potentially based on heuristics like visibility, common UI patterns, or user-defined rules.
*   **Action Simulation and State Capture:** For each identified interactive element, the module will simulate a user action (e.g., `click()`, `fill()`). Before and after each action, it will trigger the Screenshot Capture Module to record the visual state of the page. Additionally, relevant DOM information (e.g., `innerHTML`, `textContent`, attributes) will be extracted.
*   **Change Detection:** To avoid redundant actions and detect new content, the module will incorporate mechanisms to detect significant changes in the DOM or visual layout after an interaction. This could involve comparing DOM snapshots or visual hashes of screenshots.
*   **Data Extraction Rules:** The module will support configurable rules for extracting specific data points from the DOM. These rules could be based on CSS selectors, XPath, or regular expressions, allowing for flexible data collection.
*   **Loop and Redundancy Prevention:** Mechanisms to detect and prevent infinite loops during traversal (e.g., by tracking visited URLs and element interactions) and to avoid re-scraping identical content.

This module will orchestrate interactions between the Browser Control, DOM Interaction, and Screenshot Capture Modules. Its intelligence will lie in its ability to autonomously explore and document web page states, making it a powerful tool for proactive content acquisition and analysis.



## 2.5 Storage Integration Module

The Storage Integration Module will be responsible for persistently storing all captured data, including screenshots and scraped information, within the Chromium environment. This deep integration ensures that the data is managed efficiently and securely alongside other browser data.

*   **Screenshot Storage:** Captured screenshots (PNG/JPEG) will be stored in a dedicated, optimized format. This could involve leveraging Chromium's existing image storage mechanisms or implementing a custom solution that stores images as binary blobs. Metadata associated with each screenshot (e.g., URL, timestamp, element selector, viewport size) will also be stored.
*   **Scraped Data Storage:** Extracted DOM information and other scraped data will be stored in a structured format. Options include:
    *   **IndexedDB:** For client-side, transactional database storage of large amounts of structured data.
    *   **Local Storage/Session Storage:** For smaller key-value pair data, though less suitable for the volume expected from proactive scraping.
    *   **Custom Chromium Storage:** Implementing a new storage solution tailored to the specific needs of the scraping data, potentially using SQLite (which Chromium already uses for various internal databases) for robust, queryable storage.
*   **Metadata Management:** A robust metadata system will be implemented to link screenshots with the corresponding scraped data, URLs, and interaction sequences. This will enable efficient retrieval and analysis of the captured browsing sessions.
*   **Data Retrieval API:** Provide an internal API for other Chromium components or the external API layer to query and retrieve stored screenshots and scraped data based on various criteria (e.g., URL, timestamp, element type).
*   **Storage Quotas and Management:** Implement mechanisms to manage storage usage, including quotas, cleanup policies, and potentially user-facing controls for managing the stored data.

The choice of storage mechanism will depend on factors such as data volume, query complexity, and performance requirements. A hybrid approach, utilizing different storage types for different data, may be considered.



## 2.6 API Layer

The API Layer will serve as the interface for other Chromium components or external modules to interact with the C++ Playwright clone's functionality. This layer will abstract the internal complexities of the browsing, scraping, and storage modules, providing a clean and consistent set of APIs.

*   **Internal C++ API:** A direct C++ API will be exposed for use by other components within the Chromium codebase. This API will provide granular control over all functionalities, including navigation, element interaction, screenshot capture, and data retrieval.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** If the C++ Playwright clone's components are distributed across different Chromium processes (e.g., browser process, renderer process), an IPC mechanism (e.g., Mojo, Chromium's internal IPC framework) will be used to facilitate communication between these components and the API layer. This ensures efficient and secure cross-process calls.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Most operations, especially those involving browser interaction or network requests, will be asynchronous to prevent blocking the main browser thread. The API will provide callback mechanisms or futures/promises for handling asynchronous results.
*   **Error Handling:** A robust error handling mechanism will be implemented to report failures, timeouts, and other issues encountered during operations.

The API Layer will be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future additions of features and integration with other Chromium services. It will aim to provide a developer-friendly interface while maintaining the performance and security standards of Chromium.



## 3. API Interfaces and Data Structures

This section details the proposed C++ API interfaces and the data structures that will be used to interact with the Playwright-like functionality within Chromium. The API will be designed to be intuitive, efficient, and consistent with modern C++ practices.

### 3.1 Browser Control Module API

The `BrowserControl` class will provide the primary interface for managing browser contexts and pages. It will be a singleton or a factory-managed class to ensure proper resource management within Chromium.

```cpp
// Represents a browser context, isolated from others.
class BrowserContext {
public:
    // Creates a new page (tab/window) within this context.
    // Returns a unique identifier for the new page.
    PageId NewPage();

    // Closes the browser context and all associated pages.
    void Close();

    // Retrieves a Page object by its ID.
    std::unique_ptr<Page> GetPage(PageId id);

    // ... other context-specific methods (e.g., managing cookies, permissions)
};

// Represents a single web page (tab/window).
class Page {
public:
    // Navigates the page to the given URL.
    // Returns true on success, false on navigation failure or timeout.
    bool Goto(const std::string& url, const NavigationOptions& options = {});

    // Goes back in the page's history.
    bool GoBack(const NavigationOptions& options = {});

    // Goes forward in the page's history.
    bool GoForward(const NavigationOptions& options = {});

    // Reloads the current page.
    bool Reload(const NavigationOptions& options = {});

    // Closes the page.
    void Close();

    // Sets the viewport size for the page.
    void SetViewport(int width, int height);

    // Retrieves the current URL of the page.
    std::string Url() const;

    // Retrieves the title of the page.
    std::string Title() const;

    // Waits for a specific navigation event (e.g., 'load', 'domcontentloaded').
    bool WaitForNavigation(const std::string& event_name, const TimeoutOptions& options = {});

    // ... other page-specific methods (e.g., network interception, dialog handling)
};

// Options for navigation methods.
struct NavigationOptions {
    int timeout_ms = 30000; // Default timeout of 30 seconds.
    std::string wait_until = "load"; // Event to wait for: 'load', 'domcontentloaded', 'networkidle'.
};

// Generic timeout options.
struct TimeoutOptions {
    int timeout_ms = 30000;
};

// Unique identifier for a page.
using PageId = int;

// Main entry point for browser control.
class BrowserControl {
public:
    // Returns the singleton instance of BrowserControl.
    static BrowserControl& GetInstance();

    // Creates a new isolated browser context.
    // Returns a unique identifier for the new context.
    ContextId NewContext();

    // Closes a specific browser context.
    void CloseContext(ContextId id);

    // Retrieves a BrowserContext object by its ID.
    std::unique_ptr<BrowserContext> GetContext(ContextId id);

    // ... other global browser control methods
};

// Unique identifier for a browser context.
using ContextId = int;
```

This API design provides a clear separation of concerns between browser-level operations (managing contexts) and page-level operations (navigation, viewport). The use of `PageId` and `ContextId` allows for efficient internal management of these entities within Chromium. Asynchronous operations will be handled internally by the implementation, presenting a synchronous-like interface where appropriate, or returning futures/callbacks for long-running tasks.



### 3.2 DOM Interaction Module API

The `Page` class (from the Browser Control Module) will be extended with methods to interact with DOM elements. A new `Locator` class will be introduced to represent a strategy for finding elements.

```cpp
// Represents a locator for finding elements on a page.
class Locator {
public:
    // Finds a single element matching the locator.
    // Throws if no element or multiple elements are found.
    std::unique_ptr<ElementHandle> Element();

    // Finds all elements matching the locator.
    std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ElementHandle>> AllElements();

    // Clicks the element(s) matching the locator.
    bool Click(const ClickOptions& options = {});

    // Fills the input field(s) matching the locator with the given text.
    bool Fill(const std::string& text);

    // Types text character by character into the element(s).
    bool Type(const std::string& text, const TypeOptions& options = {});

    // Checks the checkbox/radio button(s) matching the locator.
    bool Check();

    // Unchecks the checkbox/radio button(s) matching the locator.
    bool Uncheck();

    // Selects options in a <select> element.
    bool SelectOption(const std::vector<std::string>& values);

    // Hovers over the element(s).
    bool Hover();

    // Drags the element(s) to a target locator.
    bool DragTo(Locator& target);

    // Returns true if the element is visible.
    bool IsVisible();

    // Returns true if the element is enabled.
    bool IsEnabled();

    // Returns true if the element is checked (for checkboxes/radio buttons).
    bool IsChecked();

    // Returns the text content of the element.
    std::string TextContent();

    // Returns the inner HTML of the element.
    std::string InnerHtml();

    // Returns the value of an attribute.
    std::string GetAttribute(const std::string& name);

    // ... other interaction and state methods
};

// Options for click actions.
struct ClickOptions {
    bool force = false; // Whether to force the click, bypassing actionability checks.
    int delay_ms = 0;   // Delay between mouse down and mouse up.
    // ... other click-related options
};

// Options for type actions.
struct TypeOptions {
    int delay_ms = 10; // Delay between key presses.
};

// Represents a handle to a specific DOM element.
// This is an internal representation and might not be directly exposed in the public API.
class ElementHandle {
public:
    // Returns the outer HTML of the element.
    std::string OuterHtml();

    // Returns the bounding box of the element.
    Rect BoundingBox();

    // ... other element-specific properties
};

// Rectangle structure for bounding boxes.
struct Rect {
    double x, y, width, height;
};

// Extension to the Page class for DOM interaction.
class Page {
public:
    // ... existing methods ...

    // Creates a locator using a CSS selector.
    Locator GetByCss(const std::string& selector);

    // Creates a locator using an XPath expression.
    Locator GetByXPath(const std::string& expression);

    // Creates a locator by accessibility role.
    Locator GetByRole(const std::string& role, const std::string& name_or_text = "");

    // Creates a locator by text content.
    Locator GetByText(const std::string& text);

    // Creates a locator by label text.
    Locator GetByLabel(const std::string& label);

    // Creates a locator by placeholder text.
    Locator GetByPlaceholder(const std::string& placeholder);

    // Creates a locator by alt text.
    Locator GetByAltText(const std::string& alt_text);

    // Creates a locator by title attribute.
    Locator GetByTitle(const std::string& title);

    // Creates a locator by test ID attribute.
    Locator GetByTestId(const std::string& test_id);

    // Evaluates a JavaScript expression in the page context.
    // Returns the JSON string representation of the result.
    std::string Evaluate(const std::string& javascript_expression);

    // ... other page-level DOM interaction methods
};
```

The `Locator` class will encapsulate the logic for finding elements and performing actions, including the actionability checks. The `Page` class will serve as the entry point for creating locators. The `ElementHandle` will be an internal representation, potentially returned by `Locator::Element()` for more direct manipulation if needed, but most common interactions will be handled directly by the `Locator` class.



### 3.3 Screenshot Capture Module API

The `Page` and `Locator` classes will be extended to include screenshot capabilities.

```cpp
// Options for screenshot capture.
struct ScreenshotOptions {
    std::string path; // File path to save the screenshot. If empty, returns buffer.
    bool full_page = false; // Whether to take a full scrollable page screenshot.
    std::string type = "png"; // Image type: "png" or "jpeg".
    int quality = 100; // JPEG quality from 0-100.
    Rect clip; // Clipping region for the screenshot.
    bool omit_background = false; // Whether to hide default white background and capture with transparency.
};

// Extension to the Page class for screenshot capture.
class Page {
public:
    // ... existing methods ...

    // Takes a screenshot of the page.
    // Returns a buffer containing the image data if path is empty.
    std::vector<uint8_t> Screenshot(const ScreenshotOptions& options = {});
};

// Extension to the Locator class for element screenshot capture.
class Locator {
public:
    // ... existing methods ...

    // Takes a screenshot of the element(s) matching the locator.
    // Returns a buffer containing the image data if path is empty.
    std::vector<uint8_t> Screenshot(const ScreenshotOptions& options = {});
};
```

The `ScreenshotOptions` struct provides a flexible way to configure various aspects of the screenshot capture, including the output path, image type, quality, and clipping regions. Both `Page` and `Locator` will offer a `Screenshot` method, allowing for both full-page/viewport and element-specific captures.



### 3.4 Proactive Scraping Module API

The Proactive Scraping Module will expose an API to initiate and manage automated scraping tasks. This will likely involve a `Scraper` class that orchestrates the browsing, interaction, and data extraction.

```cpp
// Represents a scraping task configuration.
struct ScrapingConfig {
    std::string start_url; // The initial URL to begin scraping.
    int max_depth = 5; // Maximum navigation depth for traversal.
    std::vector<std::string> allowed_domains; // Domains to restrict scraping to.
    std::vector<std::string> screenshot_selectors; // CSS selectors for elements to screenshot.
    std::map<std::string, std::string> data_extraction_rules; // Map of data_name to CSS selector for extraction.
    bool click_all_buttons = true; // Whether to proactively click all buttons.
    bool follow_all_links = true; // Whether to proactively follow all links.
};

// Represents the result of a single scraped page.
struct ScrapedPageData {
    std::string url; // URL of the scraped page.
    std::string timestamp; // Timestamp of when the page was scraped.
    std::map<std::string, std::string> extracted_data; // Extracted data based on rules.
    std::vector<std::string> screenshot_paths; // Paths to captured screenshots for this page.
    std::vector<std::string> interacted_elements; // List of elements interacted with (e.g., clicked).
};

// Main class for managing scraping operations.
class Scraper {
public:
    // Initializes a new scraping task with the given configuration.
    // Returns a unique ID for the scraping session.
    ScrapingSessionId StartScraping(const ScrapingConfig& config);

    // Stops an ongoing scraping session.
    void StopScraping(ScrapingSessionId session_id);

    // Retrieves the results for a completed or ongoing scraping session.
    std::vector<ScrapedPageData> GetScrapingResults(ScrapingSessionId session_id);

    // ... other methods for monitoring progress, pausing, resuming.
};

// Unique identifier for a scraping session.
using ScrapingSessionId = int;
```

The `ScrapingConfig` struct allows for detailed customization of the scraping process, including start URL, traversal depth, domain restrictions, and specific rules for screenshot capture and data extraction. The `ScrapedPageData` struct will encapsulate all information gathered from a single page during the scraping process. The `Scraper` class will manage the lifecycle of scraping sessions.



### 3.5 Storage Integration Module API

The Storage Integration Module will provide interfaces for storing and retrieving the `ScrapedPageData` and associated screenshots. This API will be internal to Chromium and might not be directly exposed to external users.

```cpp
// Represents a storage key for retrieving data.
struct StorageKey {
    ScrapingSessionId session_id;
    std::string url;
    std::string timestamp;
};

// Main class for interacting with the internal storage.
class StorageManager {
public:
    // Stores a single ScrapedPageData object.
    bool StoreScrapedPageData(const ScrapedPageData& data);

    // Retrieves ScrapedPageData based on a session ID.
    std::vector<ScrapedPageData> GetScrapedPageData(ScrapingSessionId session_id);

    // Stores a screenshot buffer associated with a page.
    // Returns the path where the screenshot was stored.
    std::string StoreScreenshot(ScrapingSessionId session_id, const std::string& url, const std::vector<uint8_t>& image_buffer, const std::string& format);

    // Retrieves a screenshot buffer by its path.
    std::vector<uint8_t> GetScreenshot(const std::string& path);

    // Clears all stored data for a given scraping session.
    void ClearSessionData(ScrapingSessionId session_id);

    // ... other methods for managing storage quotas, indexing, etc.
};
```

The `StorageManager` class will handle the persistence and retrieval of scraping results and screenshots. It will abstract the underlying storage mechanisms (e.g., IndexedDB, SQLite) from the rest of the system. The `StorageKey` struct provides a way to uniquely identify and retrieve stored data.



## 4. Implementation Details and Integration Points

This section delves into the specific implementation strategies and integration points within the Chromium codebase for each module of the C++ Playwright clone.

### 4.1 Browser Control Module Implementation

The Browser Control Module will primarily interact with Chromium's `content` module, which provides the core components for rendering web content. Key integration points and implementation considerations include:

*   **BrowserContext Management:**
    *   `BrowserControl::NewContext()` will internally create a new `content::BrowserContext` instance. This ensures isolation of cookies, cache, and other browser data for each scraping session, mimicking Playwright's `browser.newContext()` behavior.
    *   The `BrowserContext` object will manage its own `StoragePartition` to ensure data isolation.
    *   Closing a context (`BrowserControl::CloseContext()`) will involve proper cleanup and destruction of the associated `content::BrowserContext` and its resources.

*   **Page Management:**
    *   `BrowserContext::NewPage()` will create a new `content::WebContents` instance within the `content::BrowserContext`. `WebContents` represents the content of a web page and is the primary interface for interacting with it.
    *   Each `Page` object in our API will hold a reference to its corresponding `content::WebContents` instance.
    *   Page lifecycle events (e.g., `load`, `domcontentloaded`) will be observed by implementing `content::WebContentsObserver` and forwarding these events through our `Page` API.

*   **Navigation:**
    *   `Page::Goto()` will utilize `content::WebContents::GetController().LoadURL()` to initiate navigation. The `NavigationOptions` (e.g., `wait_until`) will determine when the navigation is considered complete. This will involve monitoring `content::WebContentsObserver` events like `DidFinishNavigation` and `DidStopLoading`.
    *   `GoBack()`, `GoForward()`, and `Reload()` will similarly use the `NavigationController` within `WebContents`.

*   **Viewport and Emulation:**
    *   `Page::SetViewport()` will configure the viewport size by interacting with the `content::RenderWidgetHostView` associated with the `WebContents`. This will involve sending IPC messages to the renderer process to update the viewport dimensions.
    *   User agent string emulation will be handled by setting the appropriate `blink::WebSettings` in the renderer process or by overriding the user agent in the `content::BrowserContext`.

**Integration with Chromium's Process Model:**
Chromium uses a multi-process architecture. The `BrowserControl` and `BrowserContext` objects will primarily reside in the browser process, while `Page` objects will interact with `WebContents` which manages communication with the renderer process (where the actual web page rendering and DOM manipulation occurs). IPC (Inter-Process Communication) via Mojo will be crucial for communication between these processes, ensuring that API calls from the browser process are translated into actions within the renderer process and vice-versa for events and data retrieval.



### 4.2 DOM Interaction Module Implementation

The DOM Interaction Module will be implemented primarily within the renderer process, leveraging Chromium's Blink rendering engine. This allows for direct and efficient manipulation and querying of the DOM. Communication between the browser process (where the API is called) and the renderer process will occur via Mojo IPC.

*   **Element Locators:**
    *   `Locator` objects will encapsulate the logic for finding elements. When a `Locator` method (e.g., `Click()`, `Element()`) is called from the browser process, an IPC message will be sent to the renderer process.
    *   In the renderer process, a dedicated `DomAgent` (or similar class) will receive these messages. It will use Blink's DOM APIs (e.g., `document.querySelector`, `document.evaluate` for XPath, `AXTree` for accessibility roles) to find matching `blink::WebElement` or `blink::Node` objects.
    *   For `getByRole`, `getByText`, etc., the implementation will involve traversing the accessibility tree (`AXTree`) or performing text searches within the DOM, similar to how Playwright implements these resilient locators.

*   **Actionability Checks:**
    *   Before performing an action, the `DomAgent` in the renderer process will execute a series of checks on the target `blink::WebElement` to determine its actionability [3]. These checks will involve:
        *   **Visibility:** Checking `blink::WebElement::isVisible()` and computed styles for `display:none` or `visibility:hidden`.
        *   **Stability:** Monitoring the element's bounding box (`blink::WebElement::boundingBox()`) over several animation frames to ensure it has stopped moving or resizing.
        *   **Receives Events:** Performing a hit test (`blink::Document::hitTest()`) at the action point to ensure no other element is obscuring the target.
        *   **Enabled/Editable:** Checking the element's `disabled` or `readonly` attributes and computed styles.
    *   These checks will be performed in a loop with timeouts, retrying until all conditions are met or the timeout expires, mimicking Playwright's auto-waiting mechanism.

*   **User Actions:**
    *   Once an element is deemed actionable, the `DomAgent` will simulate user actions by dispatching appropriate Blink events.
    *   `Click()`: Will involve dispatching `mousedown`, `mouseup`, and `click` events using `blink::WebInputEvent` and `blink::LocalFrame::sendSyntheticMouseEvent()`.
    *   `Fill()`: Will set the `value` property of input elements directly via `blink::WebElement::setValue()` and dispatch an `input` event.
    *   `Type()`: Will simulate individual key presses using `blink::WebInputEvent` and `blink::LocalFrame::sendSyntheticKeyEvent()`.
    *   Other actions like `Check()`, `Uncheck()`, `SelectOption()`, `Hover()`, and `DragTo()` will similarly translate into sequences of Blink DOM manipulations and input events.

*   **Element State and Properties:**
    *   Methods like `TextContent()`, `InnerHtml()`, `GetAttribute()` will directly query the `blink::WebElement` for its properties.
    *   `IsVisible()`, `IsEnabled()`, `IsChecked()` will perform the corresponding actionability checks and return their boolean results.

*   **Event Listeners:**
    *   The `DomAgent` can register as an observer for DOM mutations (`blink::MutationObserver`) or specific events within the renderer process to detect changes and notify the browser process via IPC, enabling proactive scraping scenarios.

**IPC Communication:**
All calls from the `Page` and `Locator` objects in the browser process will be serialized into Mojo messages and sent to the renderer process. The `DomAgent` in the renderer process will deserialize these messages, perform the requested DOM operations using Blink APIs, and send back results or errors via Mojo IPC. This ensures that the heavy lifting of DOM interaction happens where the DOM resides, minimizing cross-process overhead.



### 4.3 Screenshot Capture Module Implementation

The Screenshot Capture Module will integrate deeply with Chromium's rendering and compositing pipeline to capture high-fidelity images. This functionality will primarily reside in the browser process, coordinating with the renderer process to obtain pixel data.

*   **Full Page Screenshots:**
    *   To capture a full-page screenshot, the module will first instruct the renderer process (via IPC) to lay out the entire document, potentially by temporarily resizing the viewport to the full scrollable height and width of the page. This ensures all content is rendered.
    *   Once the full page is laid out, the browser process will request a bitmap of the entire `content::WebContents` from the `content::RenderWidgetHostView`.
    *   The `RenderWidgetHostView` will then trigger a readback of the compositor's buffer, which contains the rendered pixels of the entire page.

*   **Viewport Screenshots:**
    *   For viewport screenshots, the process is simpler. The browser process will directly request a bitmap of the current `content::WebContents` from the `RenderWidgetHostView`, which corresponds to the visible area of the page.

*   **Element Screenshots:**
    *   Capturing an element screenshot will involve a two-step process:
        1.  **Renderer Process:** The `DomAgent` in the renderer process will be used to determine the precise bounding box and layout of the target `blink::WebElement` relative to the viewport. This information (x, y, width, height) will be sent back to the browser process via IPC.
        2.  **Browser Process:** With the element's bounding box, the browser process will then request a screenshot of the `content::WebContents` but specify a clipping region (`Rect clip` in `ScreenshotOptions`) corresponding to the element's coordinates. This ensures only the element and its immediate surroundings are captured.

*   **Output Formats and Quality:**
    *   The raw pixel data (e.g., RGBA bitmap) obtained from the `RenderWidgetHostView` will be processed in the browser process.
    *   For PNG output, Chromium's internal image encoding libraries (e.g., `gfx::PNGCodec`) will be used to convert the bitmap to PNG format, supporting transparency if `omit_background` is true.
    *   For JPEG output, `gfx::JPEGCodec` will be used, with the `quality` parameter directly mapping to the compression level.
    *   If `path` is empty in `ScreenshotOptions`, the encoded image data (PNG or JPEG) will be returned as a `std::vector<uint8_t>` buffer.

*   **Transparency and Clipping:**
    *   `omit_background`: When true, the `RenderWidgetHostView` will be instructed to render with a transparent background, allowing for screenshots of elements without their page background.
    *   `clip`: The clipping rectangle will be applied during the bitmap request to the `RenderWidgetHostView`, ensuring only the specified region is captured.

**Integration with Compositor:**
The screenshot process relies heavily on Chromium's compositor (`cc::LayerTreeHost`). The compositor is responsible for combining various layers (e.g., web content, browser UI) into a single image. The `RenderWidgetHostView` acts as the bridge, allowing the browser process to request a snapshot of the rendered content from the compositor. This ensures that screenshots accurately reflect what the user sees, including CSS transforms, animations, and other visual effects.



### 4.4 Proactive Scraping Module Implementation

The Proactive Scraping Module will be a sophisticated orchestrator, primarily residing in the browser process, coordinating tasks across the Browser Control, DOM Interaction, and Screenshot Capture Modules. Its core will be an intelligent traversal engine that explores web pages, interacts with elements, and captures data.

*   **Automated Page Traversal Engine:**
    *   The engine will maintain a queue of URLs to visit and a record of visited URLs and interacted elements to prevent infinite loops and redundant actions. A graph-based representation of the web application state could be used internally.
    *   Upon navigating to a new page (`Page::Goto()`), the engine will first wait for the page to become stable (e.g., `networkidle` event).
    *   It will then use the `Page::Evaluate()` method to execute JavaScript in the renderer process to identify all interactive elements (links, buttons, form inputs) based on `ScrapingConfig::click_all_buttons` and `ScrapingConfig::follow_all_links`.
    *   For links, it will extract `href` attributes. For buttons and form submissions, it will identify their associated actions.
    *   Elements will be prioritized for interaction based on heuristics (e.g., visible elements first, unique elements, elements within the `allowed_domains`).

*   **Interaction and State Capture Loop:**
    *   For each identified interactive element, the engine will:
        1.  **Capture Pre-Interaction Screenshot:** Use `Page::Screenshot()` or `Locator::Screenshot()` to capture the current visual state of the page or element before interaction.
        2.  **Extract Pre-Interaction Data:** Use `Locator::TextContent()`, `Locator::InnerHtml()`, or `Page::Evaluate()` with custom JavaScript to extract data based on `ScrapingConfig::data_extraction_rules`.
        3.  **Simulate Interaction:** Use `Locator::Click()`, `Locator::Fill()`, etc., to simulate the user action. This will trigger navigation or DOM changes.
        4.  **Wait for Page Stability:** After interaction, wait for the page to stabilize or for a new navigation to complete.
        5.  **Capture Post-Interaction Screenshot:** Capture the visual state after the interaction.
        6.  **Extract Post-Interaction Data:** Extract data from the new page state.
        7.  **Store Data:** Package the collected data (screenshots, extracted text, interaction details, URLs) into a `ScrapedPageData` object and pass it to the `StorageManager::StoreScrapedPageData()`.

*   **Change Detection and Redundancy Prevention:**
    *   To avoid re-processing identical pages, the module can compute a hash of the page's DOM or a perceptual hash of the screenshot. If a page's hash matches a previously visited page, it can be skipped.
    *   Tracking visited URLs and the sequence of interactions will help in detecting and breaking out of potential infinite loops (e.g., navigating between two pages repeatedly).
    *   The `max_depth` in `ScrapingConfig` will provide a hard limit on traversal depth.

*   **Data Extraction and Transformation:**
    *   The `data_extraction_rules` in `ScrapingConfig` will be translated into `Locator` calls or `Page::Evaluate()` JavaScript snippets to extract specific content. For example, a rule like `{"product_name": "h1.product-title"}` would translate to `page.GetByCss("h1.product-title").TextContent()`.
    *   Extracted data will be stored as key-value pairs in `ScrapedPageData::extracted_data`.

**Integration with other Modules:**
This module will heavily rely on the `Page` and `Locator` objects from the Browser Control and DOM Interaction Modules for navigation and element interaction. It will also directly call the `Screenshot()` methods for visual capture and the `StorageManager` for persistence. IPC will be used for all cross-process communication, especially for DOM queries and actions that occur in the renderer process.



### 4.5 Storage Integration Module Implementation

The Storage Integration Module will manage the persistence of scraped data and screenshots within Chromium. Given the requirements for deep integration and efficient storage, a combination of existing Chromium storage mechanisms and potentially a custom solution will be considered.

*   **Screenshot Storage:**
    *   Screenshots will be stored as binary data. A suitable location within Chromium for large binary blobs is often the `BlobStorage` or directly within a custom SQLite database.
    *   Each screenshot will be associated with metadata (URL, timestamp, element selector, session ID) that will be stored alongside it or in a separate index.
    *   The `StoreScreenshot()` method will take the image buffer and metadata, encode it (if not already done), and write it to the chosen storage. It will return a unique path or identifier for retrieval.
    *   `GetScreenshot()` will retrieve the binary data based on the stored path/identifier.

*   **Scraped Data Storage:**
    *   For structured `ScrapedPageData`, a custom SQLite database within Chromium is a strong candidate. Chromium already uses SQLite for various internal databases (e.g., history, cookies, IndexedDB backend).
    *   A dedicated SQLite table could be designed to store `ScrapedPageData` fields (URL, timestamp, extracted data as JSON/BLOB, screenshot paths, interacted elements).
    *   This allows for efficient querying and indexing of scraped data based on session ID, URL, or other criteria.
    *   Alternatively, for simpler data structures or smaller volumes, `IndexedDB` could be used, leveraging Chromium's existing implementation. This would involve serializing `ScrapedPageData` to JSON and storing it in an IndexedDB object store.

*   **Metadata Management:**
    *   Regardless of the primary storage choice, a robust indexing system will be crucial. If using SQLite, this would involve creating appropriate indices on session IDs, URLs, and timestamps.
    *   The metadata will link `ScrapedPageData` entries to their corresponding screenshots, allowing for easy retrieval of all artifacts related to a specific page or interaction.

*   **Storage Quotas and Management:**
    *   The module will need to respect Chromium's storage quotas. If a custom storage solution is implemented, it should integrate with Chromium's quota management system.
    *   Cleanup policies (e.g., delete data older than X days, delete data for completed sessions) will be necessary to prevent excessive disk usage.

**Integration with Chromium Storage Services:**
This module will integrate with Chromium's `storage` component. If a custom SQLite database is used, it will follow Chromium's patterns for database creation, schema management, and thread-safe access. If IndexedDB is chosen, it will use the existing `blink::IndexedDB` APIs in the renderer process (via IPC) or the `content::IndexedDBContext` in the browser process.



### 4.6 API Layer Implementation

The API Layer serves as the public interface for the C++ Playwright clone within the Chromium environment. Its implementation will focus on providing a clean, stable, and efficient way for other Chromium components or external clients (via a Chromium extension or devtools protocol) to utilize the scraping functionality.

*   **Internal C++ API:**
    *   The C++ API defined in Section 3 will be implemented as a set of classes and functions residing in a dedicated namespace (e.g., `chromium_playwright::`).
    *   These classes (`BrowserControl`, `BrowserContext`, `Page`, `Locator`, `Scraper`, `StorageManager`) will be concrete implementations of the interfaces, directly orchestrating calls to the underlying modules.
    *   Care will be taken to ensure thread safety, especially for `BrowserControl` and `Scraper` which might be accessed from different threads within the browser process.

*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) via Mojo:**
    *   For functionalities that require interaction between the browser process and the renderer process (e.g., DOM manipulation, element-specific screenshots), Mojo will be the primary IPC mechanism.
    *   **Mojo Interfaces:** Define Mojo interfaces (`.mojom` files) for communication between the browser and renderer processes. For example, a `DomAgent` Mojo interface could expose methods like `PerformClick(element_id, options)`, `GetElementBoundingBox(element_id)`, `EvaluateJavaScript(script)`.
    *   **Mojo Implementation:** The browser process will implement the client side of these Mojo interfaces, making calls to the renderer. The renderer process will host the server side, implementing the actual logic using Blink APIs.
    *   **Asynchronous Nature:** Mojo calls are inherently asynchronous. The C++ API will either expose this asynchronous nature (e.g., returning `base::OnceCallback` or `base::OnceCallback<void(Result)>`) or provide synchronous wrappers that block until the Mojo response is received (carefully considering potential UI blocking).

*   **Error Handling and Reporting:**
    *   The API will return `base::Status` or similar error objects to indicate success or failure, along with detailed error messages.
    *   Exceptions will generally be avoided in the C++ API, favoring explicit error codes or status objects.
    *   Logging will be integrated with Chromium's `logging` system to provide debug information and error reporting.

*   **Integration with Chromium's Task Scheduling:**
    *   All asynchronous operations and long-running tasks will be scheduled using Chromium's `base::ThreadPool` or `content::BrowserThread::GetTaskRunnerForThread()` to ensure they run on appropriate threads and do not block the UI thread.

*   **Extensibility:**
    *   The API will be designed to be extensible, allowing new locator types, actions, or scraping configurations to be added without requiring major refactoring.
    *   This could involve using a plugin-like architecture or a flexible configuration system.

This API layer will act as the crucial bridge, making the powerful capabilities of the C++ Playwright clone accessible and manageable within the complex Chromium ecosystem. It will prioritize performance, stability, and adherence to Chromium's development best practices.
